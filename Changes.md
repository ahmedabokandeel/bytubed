1.  Preferences tab has been split into 4 sub-tabs:

    1.  "Additional Features" with the following options:

        -   "Video format does not matter. Try to get the videos in requested quality."

        -   "Preserve order (prepends the file name with the serial number)."

        -   "Silently prefetch downloadable video URLs (makes the next step faster)."

            -   "Show Max Resolution"

        -   "Try to center the window after resizing."

        -   "Maintain aspect ratio while resizing the window."

2.  In addition to "FLV" and "MP4", a new option "WebM" has been added in the Video Format
    field

    -   Radio-group has been replaced by a drop-down-menu.

    -   If a video is not available in the requested format, then among the available
        formats, the highest quality video will be fetched subject to the quality
        constraints specified in the Quality field.

3.  More specific Quality field:

    -   The set {"High", "Medium", "Low"} of quality values has been replaced by the
        following set of options:

        -   {"240p", "360p", "480p", "720p HD", "1080p HD", "Original"}

    -   "240p" to "Original" are arranged in increasing order of quality.

    -   "720p HD" is the default value.

    -   If a video is not available in the requested quality, then a lower quality video
        of the same format, as specified in the Video Format field, will be fetched.


4.  By default "What to do?" = "Generate Links"; earlier it was "Enqueue for Download"

5.  The option "Always get highest quality video (don't care whether MP4 or FLV)" has
    been replaced by "Video format does not matter. Try to get the videos in requested
    quality." under Preferences -> Additional Features

    -   This new option allows prioritizing quality over file format.

6.  "Show Max Resolution" and "Show Max Quality" under Preferences -> Additional Features

    -   To show maximum resolution and maximum quality of each video along with S.No and
        Title in Selection Window.

    -   Require silent prefetching enabled.

7.  Added an option: "Select All" in the Selection Window to select all the videos.

### Features Added

1.  **Silent prefetching** of downloadable video URLs

2.  **Grabbing more links**

    1.  Ability to grab YouTube URLs even if they are not hyperlinks to YouTube videos.
        This means that now BYTubeD can be invoked on:

        -   a page containing embedded YouTube videos, hidden video links, etc.

        -   even a text file containing some YouTube URLs here and there.

    2.  Ability to grab YouTube links from the clipboard.


3.  **Preserve Order**

    -   This option can be set to true to make sure that the videos in the destination
        directory are in the same order as they appear on the page where BYTubeD was
        invoked.

4.  **Support for WebM format**

    -   In addition to "FLV" and "MP4", a new option "WebM" has been added in the
        Video Format field

    -   If a video is not available in the requested format, then among the available
        formats, the highest quality video will be fetched subject to the quality
        constraints specified in the Quality field.

### Other Changes

1.  Generating the youtube-page-links in a sperate file; and showing only download links
    in the 'main' links file, to avoid watch links being shown in DownThemAll

    -   *download_links_bytubed@cs213.cse.iitk.ac.in.html* contains the downloadable
        video links

    -   *watch_links_bytubed@cs213.cse.iitk.ac.in.html* contains the YouTube video page
        links for all the successful and failed requests.

2.  Including, at the top of generated youtube-watch-links page:

    -   time stamp of BYTubeD invocation

    -   window/tab title/link of the source page on which BYTubeD was invoked,

3.  Added an option to generate text files containing the YouTube page links for failed
    and successful requests  (not the download links, because the download links expire
    within 7 hours after generation)

    -   Failed requests are saved in *bad_links_bytubed@cs213.cse.iitk.ac.in.txt*

    -   Successful requests are saved in *good_links_bytubed@cs213.cse.iitk.ac.in.txt*

4.  All communication happens over HTTPS rather than HTTP

5.  Change in support page:
    -   All references to http://bytubed.blogspot.com/ have been replaced by 
        http://msram.github.com/bytubed/

### Code Improvements

1.  Including swf_map as a property of YouTubeVideo and added code to make sure that
    video_info is fetched at most once for each video.

2.  Error reports will include BYTubeD version number to make developer's life easy

3.  Brought all the functions with return values to the following template:

    ```javascript
    var func = func()
    {
        var returnValue = ...;

        try
        {
            // populate returnValue
        }
        catch(error)
        {
            // handle error
        }

        return returnValue;
    }
    ```
